## 🎯 How to Deploy on Render

### Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Make sure all files are in your GitHub repository**
2. **Push any changes to the `main` branch**

### Step 2: Create Render Account & Deploy

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)** and sign up/login
2. **Click "New +" → "Web Service"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Use these settings:**
   - **Name**: `your-bot-name` (choose any name)
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python main.py`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In Render dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
API_ID=your_api_id_from_my.telegram.org
API_HASH=your_api_hash_from_my.telegram.org
PASSWORD=your_secure_password
OWNER_USER_ID=your_telegram_user_id (optional - for access control)
```

**Note:** Since you're the only user, you set your API credentials once in the environment. All your work accounts will use these same credentials for connections.

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Click "Create Web Service"**
2. **Wait for deployment** (takes 2-5 minutes)
3. **Check logs** to make sure everything started correctly

## 🧪 Testing Your Bot

## 🔄 Automatic GitHub Deployment

I've set up automatic deployment! Here's how it works:

### What Happens Automatically:
1. **You push changes to GitHub main branch**
2. **GitHub Actions runs tests**
3. **Render automatically deploys the new version**
4. **Your bot restarts with new features**

### To Push Changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your change description"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 How the Bump Service Works (Simple Explanation)

### What is a "Bump Service"?
Think of it like a **robot assistant** that posts your advertisements automatically:

1. **You create a campaign** (like "Daily Product Sale")
2. **You write your ad** (the message to post)
3. **You choose where to post** (which channels/groups)
4. **You set a schedule** (when to post - daily at 2 PM, every 4 hours, etc.)
5. **The bot does the rest automatically!**

### Example Campaign:
- **Name**: "Daily Crypto News"
- **Ad Content**: "🚀 Check out today's crypto updates! Join @mychannel"
- **Target Chats**: @channel1, @channel2, @mygroup
- **Schedule**: Daily at 14:00 (2 PM)
- **Result**: Every day at 2 PM, your ad gets posted to all 3 places automatically!

## 🛠️ Managing Your Bot

### Adding New Features
1. **Tell me what you want to add**
2. **I'll write the code**
3. **Push to GitHub**
4. **Render automatically deploys**

### Monitoring
- **Check Render logs** for any errors
- **Use bot's built-in statistics** to see performance
- **Test features regularly**

### Troubleshooting
- **Bot not responding**: Check Render logs
- **Campaigns not running**: Verify account credentials
- **Messages not sending**: Check chat permissions

3. **Monitor success rates** and adjust timing
4. **Keep ad content engaging** and not too frequent
