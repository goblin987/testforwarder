# 🔒 Security & Privacy Features

## 🎯 **Why This Bot is More Secure**

### **✅ User-Owned API Credentials**
- **Each user provides their own API credentials** from my.telegram.org
- **No shared API access** - your credentials are only used for your accounts
- **Bot owner cannot access your Telegram data** beyond what you explicitly configure
- **Complete data isolation** between users

### **🔐 How It Works**

#### **Traditional Approach (Less Secure):**
```
Bot Owner's API Credentials
    ↓
All Users' Accounts
    ↓
Bot Owner can potentially access all data
```

#### **Our Approach (More Secure):**
```
User 1's API Credentials → User 1's Accounts Only
User 2's API Credentials → User 2's Accounts Only  
User 3's API Credentials → User 3's Accounts Only
    ↓
Complete isolation - no cross-user access possible
```

## 🛡️ **Privacy Protection**

### **What the Bot Owner CAN'T See:**
- ❌ Your Telegram messages content (unless you forward them)
- ❌ Your personal chats or private data
- ❌ Your account session tokens (encrypted in database)
- ❌ Your API credentials (stored encrypted)

### **What the Bot Owner CAN See:**
- ✅ Bot usage statistics (how many users, campaigns created)
- ✅ Error logs (for debugging, no personal data)
- ✅ Configuration names you create (not the actual content)

## 🔑 **API Credentials Explained**

### **What You Need to Get:**
1. **Go to https://my.telegram.org**
2. **Log in with your phone number**
3. **Go to "API development tools"**
4. **Create a new application**
5. **Save your API ID and API Hash**

### **Why Each User Needs Their Own:**
- **Security**: Your credentials = your control
- **Privacy**: No shared access to anyone's data
- **Compliance**: Follows Telegram's terms of service
- **Isolation**: Your accounts are completely separate from others

## 📊 **Data Storage**

### **What's Stored in Database:**
- ✅ **Account names** (e.g., "Personal Account", "Work Account")
- ✅ **Phone numbers** (for account identification)
- ✅ **Encrypted API credentials** (your API ID/Hash)
- ✅ **Encrypted session strings** (for maintaining connections)
- ✅ **Campaign configurations** (your forwarding/ad rules)
- ✅ **Performance statistics** (success rates, send counts)

### **What's NOT Stored:**
- ❌ **Message content** (unless you explicitly configure forwarding)
- ❌ **Personal chat data** 
- ❌ **Unencrypted passwords or tokens**
- ❌ **Data from accounts you don't add to the bot**

## 🚀 **Benefits of This Approach**

### **For Users:**
- **Complete control** over your own data
- **No dependency** on bot owner's API limits
- **Better performance** (your own API quotas)
- **Full privacy** - bot owner can't access your data

### **For Bot Owner:**
- **No liability** for users' data
- **No API limit sharing** issues
- **Cleaner separation** of concerns
- **Better compliance** with privacy laws

## 🔧 **Technical Security Features**

### **Database Security:**
- **SQLite with encryption** for sensitive data
- **Session strings encrypted** at rest
- **API credentials hashed** before storage
- **No plaintext sensitive data** in logs

### **Connection Security:**
- **Each user's connections** use their own credentials
- **Isolated Telegram sessions** per account
- **Secure session management** with automatic cleanup
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### **Code Security:**
- **Input validation** on all user inputs
- **SQL injection protection** with parameterized queries
- **Error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive data
- **Secure configuration** management

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Your Responsibilities:**
1. **Keep your API credentials secure** - don't share them
2. **Use strong passwords** for your Telegram account
3. **Monitor your bot usage** through the interface
4. **Report any suspicious activity** immediately

### **Bot Owner Responsibilities:**
1. **Secure server management** and regular updates
2. **Database encryption** and backup security
3. **Code security** and vulnerability patches
4. **Transparent communication** about any changes

## 🆘 **If Something Goes Wrong**

### **Compromised API Credentials:**
1. **Revoke them immediately** at my.telegram.org
2. **Create new credentials** 
3. **Update them in the bot** through "Manage Accounts"

### **Suspicious Activity:**
1. **Check campaign statistics** for unusual activity
2. **Review your forwarding configurations**
3. **Contact bot owner** if needed
4. **Consider temporarily disabling** campaigns

## ✅ **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check your campaigns and statistics regularly
2. **Credential Rotation**: Consider updating API credentials periodically  
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Only add accounts you actually need
4. **Test First**: Always test campaigns before going live
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep track of bot updates and security patches
